## 0x03 When to Use

在如下几种情况下，需要使用 present continous
1. 在说出的时候，动作正在做还没有结束[Rule 01](#Rule%2001)
2. 在说出的时候，动作正在这个过程中，强调过程[Rule 02](#Rule%2002)
3. 当强调 periods arround now 时，例如 today/this week/this year[Rule 03](#Rule%2003)
4. 当事物在当下正在发生改变时[Rule 03](#Rule%2003)

### Rule 01

看一个例子

> Sarah is in her car. She is on her way to work. She’s driving to work.
> 
> This means: she is driving now, at the time of speaking. The action is not finished

在说出的时候，动作正在做还没有结束

```
doing something = is doing at the time of speaking
```

例如
1. Please don't make so much noise. I'm tring to work
2. Where's Mark? He's having a shower.
3. Let's go out now. It isn't ranning.
4. How's your new job? Are you enjoying it?
5. What's all the noise? What's going on?

### Rule 02

看一个例子

> Steve is talking to a friend on the phone. He says:
> I'm reading a really good book at the moment.
> 
> Steve says 'I'm reading ...' but he is not reading the book at the time of speaking.
> He means he started reading the book, but he hasn't finished yet. He is in the middle of reading it.

在说出的时候，动作正在这个过程中，强调过程

```
doing something = in the middle of doing it
```

例如
1. Kate wants to work in Italy, so she's learning Itanlian.(but perhaps she isn't learning Itanlian at the time of speaking.)
2. Some friends of mine are building their own house. Thy hope to finish it next summer.

### Rule 03

当强调 periods arround now 时，例如 today/this week/this year.

例如
1. You're working hard today.
2. The company I work for isn't doing so well this year.

### Rule 04

当事物在当下正在发生改变时

通常这些 verbs 会使用如下形式

getting,becoming
changing,improving
starting,begining
increasing,rising,falling,growing

例如
1. Is your English getting better?
2. The population of the world is increasing very fast.
3. At first I didn't like my job, but I'm starting to enjoy it now.
