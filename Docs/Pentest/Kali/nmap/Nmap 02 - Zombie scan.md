# Nmap 02 - Zombie scan



## 0x01 Overview

TCP/IP 中有如下规则

1. One way to determine whether a TCP port is open is  to send a SYN (session establishment) packet to the port.  The  target machine will respond with a SYN/ACK (session request  acknowledgment) packet if the port is open, and RST (reset) if the  port is closed.  This is the basis of the previously discussed SYN  scan.
2. A machine that receives an unsolicited SYN/ACK  packet will respond with a RST. An unsolicited RST will be  ignored.
3. Every IP packet on the Internet has a fragment  identification number  (IP ID).  Since many operating systems simply  increment this number for each packet they send, probing for  the IPID can tell an attacker how many packets have been sent  since the last probe.

所以 Intrusion detection system (IDS) 很容易分别 attacker 并将其封禁。这时就可以使用 Zombie scan 来欺骗 IDS
